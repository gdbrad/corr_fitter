# corr_fitter

Library for performing lattice qcd correlator analysis. This version is specifically for analysis of the hyperon mass spectrum, excluding the nucelon and delta correlators for now. See the conference proceedings here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01343 *Publication forthcoming* 

Nucleon and delta system will be subject of their own project, namely the nucleon sigma term.
